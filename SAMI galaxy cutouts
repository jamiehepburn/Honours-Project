SAMI galaxy cutouts

These directories contain cutouts of images of SAMI galaxies from the PanSTARRS, KiDS and HSC surveys, including colour images and FITS files with original HDUs and corrected WCS. For now, these are the stacked and sky-subtracted images provided by each survey team.
Note that HSC PDR1 only covers about 1/3 of the GAMA fields, so only 1914/5539 galaxies are available (the rest of the files are zero bytes).
Update (2019/06/21): With the release of HSC PDR2, there is now a directory (cutouts-pdr2) with small cutouts based on PDR2. Unlike PDR1, which only contained regions observed to the full planned depth in every band, PDR2 includes regions with incomplete observations. Thus, all GAMA galaxies have at least some data, but not to the same depth. Some fraction (~10-20%) have missing or unuseable data in one or more filters. Please be careful with HSC images because many brighter galaxies have saturated centers, especially in the i-band, so you must use the bitmask planes (hdu 2). Also note that PDR2 used an updated data reduction pipeline, so the images will not be identical for galaxies that were also in PDR1.

The small cutouts are 1' across, or 30" from the center of the galaxy. This makes a 300x300 cutout for KiDS (0.2" pixel scale), 360x360 for HSC (0.168" pixel scale) and 240x240 for PanSTARRS (0.25" pixel scale). Note that the native pixel scales of KiDS and PanSTARRS are 0.214" and 0.258" respectively, so artifacts from rebinning may be present. The HSC pixel scale is actually 0.168" and not 1/6" as I thought, so the cutouts are very slightly larger than KiDS. Annoyingly, pixel matching KiDS to HSC requires rescaling by 25/21 and cutting 20/7 pixels.

The big KiDS cutouts are 1500x1500 pixels for cutouts centered on a single galaxy. Cutouts that contain multiple galaxies are 2000x2000 and centered on the mean position of the SAMI galaxies within the cutout. To avoid duplication, there are symbolic links to the appropriate file for the other SAMI galaxies within these cutouts. These cutouts are mainly intended for PSF fitting and are quite large, so I have only included the images and not the FITS files for now - the images are at least useful for group galaxies and the small fraction of galaxies which don't fit in the small cutouts. If you would like the full FITS files, let me know. A small handful of very nearby galaxies are so large that they are not contained even in the big cutouts (e.g. 251941 which is NGC 5746); however, most of these issues also have serious artifacts and/or poor sky subtraction and would need re-processing to be useable anyway.

Update (2019/06/21): There are now two sets of RGB [gri] images. The old ones (rgb-old) were done with some R code I wrote a while back and logarithmic scaling that probably did not correctly preserve colours at all intensities and has muted colours for reasons I don't quite understand. The new ones are done with astropy's make_lupton_rgb using an asinh scaling (http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/rgb.html#astropy-visualization-rgb), again scaled such that solar colours are white. They are more colourful and more importantly have useful colours for faint sources. The code I used to make these new images is provided here (make_rgb.py).

"Old" RGB images are gri composites on a logarithmic scale, rescale such that solar colours appear white. Because the i-band is slightly shallower in KiDS, the red channel appears noisier in KiDS. The images have (approximately) the same maximum level and a dynamic range of 2, 2.5 and 3.5 dex for PanSTARRS, KiDS and HSC, respectively. I used the KiDS masks to mask saturated stars where available. I have not been able to find out what the HSC mask codes mean, so I didn't use them. Also, I'm not certain what units the PanSTARRS images are in, so the colour balance is off in many of those cutouts; however, they're much shallower than KiDS so there's little reason to use them other than to gauge the benefits of deeper/sharper images.

The "kin" folder in KiDS/HSC contains r-band images coloured by SAMI *stellar* kinematics. This is done by keeping the value of the pixels proportional to the r-band flux and changing the hue and saturation according to the velocity and dispersion. The scaling is as follows: velocities from 0:300 km/s map to 1:0.4 in the red channel, and -300:0 km/s map to 1:0.4 in blue. The slight overlap means that spaxels with zero velocity will be purple. The normalization is sqrt(v) rather than linear; these scalings can be adjusted if desired. The green channel contains dispersions remapped from 50:250 km/s with linear scaling. Zero-velocity spaxels are thus purple for sigma < 50 km/s, white for sigma~130 km/s and green beyond that. Spaxels with v/sigma ~ 1 appear yellow/cyan.

Note that the KiDS cutouts have the name of the source tile in the filename. This is because some galaxies near the edge of two tiles were observed in both (e.g. 106618). However, some galaxies very near the edge (e.g. 79635) apparently fell outside of the nominal tile boundary and only have a cutout from the closest tile. In my experience, however, there are significant residuals in the sky subtraction near tile edges, so the second image for galaxies near the edge tends to be quite poor (e.g. 106065).

KiDS cutouts also suffer badly from ghosting near bright stars (e.g. 41232). There are also some tiles with irregular artifacts of unknown origin (e.g. 40572, 106767).
